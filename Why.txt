What draws me to Data Science is its interdisciplinary nature. Data science combines various domains like computer science, statistics, mathematics, and domain-specific knowledge. For a CS enthusiast like me, a data science course will offer a unique perspective on how computer science techniques and principles are applied in conjunction with other disciplines to extract meaningful information from data.
